### Lessons 63 to 67

This section was done in jQuery because we could not quickly find a JavaScript solution for jQuery's 
getJSON(). 

This section is broken into two parts. This portion covers lessons 63 to 67. 

The other section in this directory contains lessons 68 and 69 which completes Section 14.
